# Frog-Hopper-Game
Based on Hoppers: The Peg Solitaire Game (Code written in 2016)

Set the frogs on the grid and jump the frogs until the red frog is the only one left standing!

Rules: 
1) Frogs move from tile to tile only when there is one frog in between the first and final destination
2) You may only move by jumping over another frog on an adjacent tile, and landing on the next tile
3) when a frog is jumped over, it will be removed from the board
4) You cannot jump over a red frog
5) No non-jump moves are allowed. Frogs cannot jump over an empty tile. No frog may land on another frog. No frog may jump over two tiles at a time
6) The challenge is solved when only the red tile is left on the board

How to Play:
Click on the frog that you would like to move, then click the place you want to move it to.
The frog that is hopped over will be removed from the board.
Click on the bolded tile twice to cancel your pick.
